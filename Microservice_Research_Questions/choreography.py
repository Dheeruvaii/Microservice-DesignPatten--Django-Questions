Choreography in the context of microservices refers to a decentralized approach where services communicate with each other through events or messages.
In choreography, each service plays an active role in collaborating with others by publishing events or messages, 
                and services react to the events they are interested in without a central orchestrator.

                
Q2.E-commerce API that consists of multiple microservices, such as
product management, inventory management, order management, and payment processing. 
Here's an example of how choreography can be implemented in this scenario:

"""
# product_service/views.py

from django.http import JsonResponse

def create_product(request):
    # Extract product details from the request and create the product
    
    # Publish a product_created event
    publish_event('product_created', product_details)

    # Update inventory
    # ...

    here the operations of choreograohy approach for communications amongst microservices

The product service creates a new product and publishes a "product_created" event containing the product details.
The inventory service subscribes to the "product_created" event and triggers the handle_product_created_event function, extracting the product details from the event payload.
The update_inventory function in the inventory service performs validations, business logic, and updates the inventory based on the product creation.
